# Tonie's Workshop 🚀

Welcome to **Tonie's Workshop** — my digital garage where I design, build, and experiment with everything from sleek UIs to hardware-powered code hacks.  
Here, I turn ideas into working prototypes, explore new tools, and push my coding skills further — one project at a time.

## 💡 Philosophy

I believe in **learning by doing** — breaking things, fixing them, and understanding *why* they broke.  
My workflow mixes creativity and logic: design something that looks good, then make sure it runs fast and clean.

> “I code out of curiosity, build for fun, and love blending software with hardware.”
