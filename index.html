                            Hi! I'm Tonie, a passionate hobbyist programmer and a Grade 10 student with a deep love for coding and creating web applications in my spare time. My journey into the world of programming began with curiosity and quickly grew into a passion for developing innovative solutions and interactive experiences. I enjoy experimenting with different languages and frameworks, constantly pushing my skills in both front-end and back-end development. Beyond web applications, I’m fascinated by hardware programming, often working with microcontrollers like Arduino and Raspberry Pi to bring my ideas to life. Whether I'm crafting clean, functional code or exploring new technologies, I’m driven by a desire to learn, create, and make a positive impact through technology.
